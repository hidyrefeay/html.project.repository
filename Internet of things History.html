<h2>The history and future of IoT

Itâ€™s not science fiction. We are living connected lives filled with internet-enabled devices that learn our preferences and provide the experiences we want to make our lives more convenient. And the technology that makes it possible to connect our lives is expanding.

It all started in the early 1980s when Carnegie Mellon University students developed the first internet-connected device. It was a Coke vending machine that would tell the programmers if the soda was cold enough for them to want to make the trip from their desks to the machine.

Since then, the IoT has exploded. What about the future? Devices are growing smaller and smarter. Eventually, everything from your toothbrush to your toaster may be connected to the internet 24x7. Your gadgets will become household aides, each chatting with one another, working to serve you better.</h2>
