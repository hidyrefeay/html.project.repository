<h2>What are the benefits of the IoT?

The Internet of Things is designed to make our lives more convenient. Here are a few examples:

    -Smart bathroom scales working in tandem with your treadmill, delivering food preparation ideas to your laptop or smartphone, so you stay healthy.
	
    -Security devices monitoring your home, turning lights on and off as you enter and exit rooms, and streaming video so you can check in while youâ€™re away.
	
    -Smart voice assistants placing your usual takeout order on command, making it a breeze to get fresh food delivered to your door.
