<h2>IoT security and privacy: What you need to know

What could go wrong? As with any technology, there’s the potential for good and bad.

Convenience is good. But connectedness can also open the door to cybercriminals. Cyberattacks already access data like bank logins, credit card numbers, and more. Strong security is essential.

Consider some of the potential risks of IoT — and those mini CPUs. What if someone hacks your IoT security cameras and watches your every move? What if a cybercriminal commandeers your smart TV, smoke alarms, or front-door lock? Connectedness can create vulnerabilities.

It’s smart to help ensure these connections stay safe and secure — just like you protect yourself against cybercrime. The Internet of Things will continue to open up opportunities for new online threats.

One of the best ways to help defend your networked devices is to make sure that your router is secure. That way, it can protect your entire home Wi-Fi network and the devices connected to it. Think of your Wi-Fi router as the front door to your online world.</h2>
